# Netflix Data Analysis With Power BI

## Project Overview
This project involves data analytics practices, including **data cleaning**, **data modeling**, and **report generation** using Power BI. The dataset comprises only dimensional columns from Netflix, highlighting trends and insights such as title distribution, genres, ratings, and country-specific data.

The objective of this project was to analyze the Netflix dataset to provide meaningful insights and visualizations to understand global streaming trends.

## Data Cleaning Process
To prepare the dataset for analysis, I performed the following data cleaning steps:

1. **Renamed Columns**: Ensured column names were clear and descriptive.

2. **Handled Missing Values**: Replaced null values or removed incomplete rows.

3. **Split Combined Columns**: Split values in multi-value columns for better granularity.

4. **Filtered Data**: Removed redundant or irrelevant records for a cleaner dataset.

5. **Unpivoted Columns**: Transformed wide data into long-form data for better visualization flexibility.

## Power BI Report Overview
The analysis results are visualized across three interactive report sheets in Power BI:
